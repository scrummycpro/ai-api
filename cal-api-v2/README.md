Here's a basic documentation template for your Flask application and how to run it using Docker:

---

## Flask API Documentation

### Overview

This Flask application provides a simple API for managing tasks in a SQLite database.

### Installation and Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

#### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone the repository containing your Flask application (`task-api-v2.py`).
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Create a Dockerfile in the root directory with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use Alpine Linux as the base image
   FROM alpine:latest

   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install Python 3, pip, and system dependencies
   RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip gcc musl-dev libffi-dev sqlite-dev

   # Install Flask and sqlite3
   RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask --break-system-packages

   # Copy your Flask application script into the container
   COPY task-api-v2.py .

   # Expose port 12349 (replace with your desired port)
   EXPOSE 12349

   # Command to run the Flask application
   CMD ["python3", "task-api-v2.py"]
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-task-api .
   ```

### Running the Flask Application

4. Run the Docker container from the built image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 12349:12349 flask-task-api
   ```

   This command maps port 12349 of the host machine to port 12349 inside the Docker container where your Flask application is running.

### API Endpoints

- **POST `/tasks`**: Create a new task.
  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"task":"Complete project", "description":"Finish documentation", "ranking":8}' \
       http://localhost:12349/tasks
  ```

- **GET `/tasks`**: Retrieve all tasks.
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:12349/tasks
  ```

- **GET `/tasks/<ranking>`**: Retrieve tasks by ranking.
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:12349/tasks/8
  ```

- **PATCH `/tasks/<id>`**: Update a task by ID.
  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"task":"Updated task name", "description":"Updated task description", "ranking":7}' \
       http://localhost:12349/tasks/1
  ```

- **DELETE `/tasks/<id>`**: Delete a task by ID.
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:12349/tasks/1
  ```

### Notes

- Replace `task-api-v2.py` with your actual Flask application script name if different.
- Modify port numbers (`12349`) in the Dockerfile and curl commands as per your configuration.

This documentation provides a basic outline of how to set up, run, and interact with your Flask API using Docker. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific application requirements and environment setup.

Here's the documentation for running your Flask application using Docker, including Docker commands and a Docker Compose file:

### Running Flask Application with Docker

#### Docker Command

To run your Flask application using Docker and attach the current directory as a volume:

```bash
docker run -d -p 12349:12349 -v "$(pwd)":/app --name task-api task-api
```

- `-d`: Detached mode (run container in the background).
- `-p 12349:12349`: Maps port 12349 on the host to port 12349 in the container.
- `-v "$(pwd)":/app`: Mounts the current directory (`$(pwd)`) as a volume inside the container at `/app`.
- `--name task-api`: Assigns a name `task-api` to the container.
- `task-api`: Specifies the Docker image name.

#### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  task-api:
    image: task-api
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - "12349:12349"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_APP=task-api-v2.py
      - FLASK_ENV=development
```

To run your application using Docker Compose, use the following commands:

1. **Build and Start:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   - `-d`: Detached mode (run containers in the background).
   - `--build`: Builds the Docker images before starting the containers.

2. **Stop:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

   This stops and removes the Docker containers.

### Documentation

#### Running the Application

1. **Using Docker:**

   - Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory containing `task-api-v2.py` and `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to start the application in detached mode.

2. **Accessing the Application:**

   - Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:12349`.
   - Use `curl` or a similar tool to interact with the API endpoints.

3. **Stopping the Application:**

   - To stop the application and remove containers, run `docker-compose down` in the same directory where `docker-compose.yml` is located.

#### Notes:

- Adjust the port numbers (`12349`) in the commands if your Flask application uses a different port.
- Ensure your Flask application script (`task-api-v2.py`) is correctly configured to listen on the specified port and handle API requests.

This documentation provides a clear guide for running your Flask application using Docker, whether through direct Docker commands or Docker Compose for more complex setups.


To create the documentation and Docker Compose file for RabbitMQ along with the script using jq, here's a detailed guide:

### Docker Compose File (docker-compose.yml)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:management
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"     # RabbitMQ standard port
      - "15672:15672"   # RabbitMQ management UI port
    volumes:
      - ./rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq   # Volume for persistent data storage

```

### Documentation: Using RabbitMQ with jq and Docker Compose

#### Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up RabbitMQ with Docker Compose, attaching a volume for persistence, and using jq to process messages from a queue. RabbitMQ will be accessed via its management UI and CLI tools.

#### Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Basic understanding of Docker and command-line tools.

#### Setup RabbitMQ with Docker Compose

1. **Create a Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`)**:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     rabbitmq:
       image: rabbitmq:management
       ports:
         - "5672:5672"     # RabbitMQ standard port
         - "15672:15672"   # RabbitMQ management UI port
       volumes:
         - ./rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq   # Volume for persistent data storage
   ```

   This Compose file sets up a RabbitMQ container with the management plugin enabled, exposing ports `5672` for AMQP and `15672` for the management UI. It also mounts a local volume `./rabbitmq_data` to persist RabbitMQ data.

2. **Start RabbitMQ Container**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will download the RabbitMQ image if not already present and start the container in detached mode (`-d`).

3. **Access RabbitMQ Management UI**:

   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:15672`.
   - Log in using credentials: Username: `guest`, Password: `guest`.
   - You can monitor queues, exchanges, and messages using the management UI.

#### Using jq to Process RabbitMQ Messages

Now, let's assume you have a script (`process-queue.sh`) that fetches messages from a queue (`tasks_queue`) and processes them using `jq`.

1. **Script to Fetch and Process Messages (`process-queue.sh`)**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Fetch messages from RabbitMQ queue
   messages=$(curl -u guest:guest -XPOST \
     http://localhost:15672/api/queues/%2F/tasks_queue/get \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{"count": 1, "requeue": true, "encoding": "auto", "ackmode": "ack_requeue_true"}' | jq -r '.[].payload')

   # Process each message using jq
   echo "$messages" | while read -r message; do
       echo "Processing message: $message"
       # Add your processing logic here
       echo "$message" >> todo_list.txt  # Append message to todo_list.txt
   done
   ```

   - This script uses `curl` to fetch one message (`"count": 1`) from the `tasks_queue`.
   - It pipes the output to `jq` to extract the `.payload` from each message and then processes each message, appending it to `todo_list.txt`.

2. **Running the Script**:

   - Make sure the RabbitMQ container (`rabbitmq`) is running (`docker-compose up -d`).
   - Run your script to fetch and process messages:

     ```bash
     bash process-queue.sh
     ```

3. **Viewing Messages**:

   - After running the script, you can check `todo_list.txt` to see the appended messages.

#### Conclusion

This setup allows you to effectively use RabbitMQ with Docker Compose, process messages from queues using `jq` for JSON manipulation, and ensure persistence with Docker volumes. Adjust the queue name (`tasks_queue`) and processing logic in the script as per your application's requirements.

By following these steps, you can integrate RabbitMQ into your workflow for reliable message processing and queuing tasks effectively.
