  "response": "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere.\n\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), as well as aerosols like water vapor, dust, and pollen. These small particles scatter the light in all directions, but they do so more effectively for shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet, than for longer wavelengths, like red and orange.\n\nAs a result of this scattering, the blue and violet light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, making the sky appear blue to our eyes. The color we see is actually a combination of the scattered blue light and the direct sunlight that reaches us.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere.\n2. Small particles in the air (like N2, O2, water vapor, dust, etc.) scatter the light.\n3. Short-wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered more than long-wavelength light (red and orange).\n4. The scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to Earth's atmosphere; other planets and moons in our solar system also have blue skies due to similar scattering effects. However, the specific color we see can vary depending on factors like atmospheric conditions, dust levels, and the presence of pollutants.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why the sky isn't actually purple or violet, given that those colors are scattered more efficiently than blue. That's because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light, making blue the most prominent color we perceive in the sky.",
